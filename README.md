## What does it do?
This project takes user input and pulls .gifs from Giphy and posts them on the page. Users are able to save .gifs as favorites on the page (which are saved locally and persist after refresh etc)

## How is this useful?
Mostly it was usefull for me to practice ajax calls, JSON stringify and parsing, as well as local storage. Most phone chat apps have something similar, but this information might be useful for future projects (maybe on the RPS one I might try and add the ability to send .gifs or emoticons...) 

## How do I use this website?
1. Type your search into the search bar and hit the search key (magnifying glass)
1. It will show gifs on the page (based on the search term) and add a button with the term.
1. You may click the created button to show that search terms .gifs again.
1. You can click the more .gifs button to show more of the same search term.
1. You can click the heart button to save a gif as a favorite.
1. When you click the Favorites button the gifs saved as favorites will display.
